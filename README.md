This repo contains all the files that we (UG2k24) have had to use in our CLD specific courses. Material for other common courses can be found in other repos, like those hosted at 
1) https://github.com/shahiam/IIIT-CourseWork
2) https://github.com/sanyamseac/exams2k24
3) https://github.com/Neriums05/IIIT_Stuff.git

P.S: ITL-1 never had assignments that had to be submitted online, instead Raja sir had us submit the answers by the end of the class on a slip of paper, so they have not been included here :(

Welcome to IIIT! <3
